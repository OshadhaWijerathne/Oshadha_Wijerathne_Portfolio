            Hello! I'm {YOUR_NAME},a passionate and results-driven Computer Science and Engineering graduate with a strong foundation in Data Science,Machine Learning, and AI. My journey into technology began with a fascination for how data can be used to solve real-world problems and uncover meaningful insights.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a solid foundation in machine learning, statistical modeling, and full-stack development, I love turning complex ideas into clean, scalable, and intelligent systems. I'm equally excited about building end-to-end AI and machine learning solutions, whether itâ€™s creating multi-agent systems with LLMs or developing predictive models to classify data and make forecasts.          </p>
          <p>
            I thrive in fast-paced environments and constantly challenge myself to learn, grow, and stay ahead of the tech curve.
